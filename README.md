Pagination Handling: Automatically navigates through multiple pages to ensure comprehensive data extraction.
Error Handling: Manages missing elements and unavailable pages gracefully.
Data Storage: Stores the scraped data in a CSV file for easy access and analysis.
ðŸ’¡ How It Works
The script launches the website using Selenium's Chrome WebDriver.
It extracts quotes, their authors, and tags using XPath for precise element location.
Handles pagination to scrape data from all available pages.
Saves the extracted data to a CSV file using Pandas.

Tags: Associated tags for the quote.

ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience with Selenium for web automation and data extraction.
Deep understanding of XPath and dynamic web element handling.
Insights into handling edge cases like missing elements and broken pagination.
Practical use of Pandas for data storage and manipulation.
ðŸŒŸ Future Enhancements
